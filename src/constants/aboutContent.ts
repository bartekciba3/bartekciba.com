    "Hi, I'm a 20-year-old personal trainer from Ballinasloe, Ireland, with a passion for fitness, health, and helping others become the best version of themselves.",
    
    "My journey started on the football pitch, playing soccer with my local club from a young age. In secondary school, I found a new love in rugby and excelled in the sport. But it was at 16, when I first stepped into a gym, that everything changed. I quickly developed a deep passion for training and by 17, I set my sights on becoming a natural bodybuilder — committed to staying natural because I've always believed that true fitness starts with good health.",
    
    "Like many, I started by learning from the internet and the experienced lifters I met at the gym. That curiosity grew into a deeper interest in how the body works, which led me to study Public Health Nutrition at college. That education gave me a science-backed foundation in everything from training to nutrition and lifestyle.",
    
    "In 2025, I proudly took first place in the Natural Junior category at a Muscle Contest in Dublin — a moment that confirmed my commitment and showed me how far dedication can take you.",
    
    "Now, I'm here to share what I've learned — both from years of hands-on experience and academic study — to help others achieve their goals in a sustainable, healthy way. Whether you're just starting out or looking to take things to the next level, I'm ready to help you build real strength — inside and out."
